The Fuel Java SDK enables developers to easily access the
Salesforce Marketing Cloud (formerly ExactTarget)
from the Java platform. Among other things, the Java SDK:
</p>

<ul>
<li>
automatically acquires and refreshes Marketing Cloud access tokens
</li>
<li>
enables developers to access both Marketing Cloud SOAP and REST
APIs in the same session
</li>
<li>
exposes simplified versions of the most commonly used Marketing
Cloud objects and methods as Java native objects
</li>
<li>
provides passthroughs so developers can access the full
REST and SOAP APIs directly when they need to go beyond
the simplified interfaces
</li>
<li>
adds "sugar" methods for the most commonly used Marketing Cloud
features that make it easy to use those features (e.g., the SDK
provides a SQL-like interface to data extensions)
</li>
</ul>

<p>
To use the Java SDK, you first need to instantiate
an <code>ETClient</code> object:
</p>

<pre>
ETClient client = new ETClient();
</pre>

<p>
The Java SDK is highly configurable. By default, configuration is
read from a properties file named <code>fuelsdk.properties</code>,
which should be located in your class path.
Alternatively, you can pass in the path of the file to be read as
an argument to the <code>ETClient</code> constructor:
</p>

<pre>
ETClient client = new ETClient("fuelsdk.properties");
</pre>

<p>
You can also pass in a programmatically constructed
<code>ETConfiguration</code> object:
</p>

<pre>
ETConfiguration configuration = new ETConfiguration();
configuration.setClientId("clientIdGoesHere");
configuration.setClientSecret("clientSecretGoesHere");

ETClient client = new ETClient(ETConfiguration);
</pre>

<p>
Once the client has been initialized, you interacted
with the API using its <code>create</code>, <code>retrieve</code>,
<code>update</code>, and <code>delete</code> methods.
</p>

<p>
In addition, some objects (e.g., <code>ETDataExtension</code>
and <code>ETTriggeredEmail</code> contain object native
methods (e.g., <code>insert</code>, <code>select</code>,
<code>update</code>, and <code>delete</code>
for <code>ETDataExtension</code> and <code>send</code> for
<code>TriggeredEmail</code>). For information on these
object native methods, please see the class documentation.
